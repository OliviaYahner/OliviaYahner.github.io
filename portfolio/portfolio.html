            Hello, welcome! My name is Olivia Yahner. I am an aspiring writer with an interest in different type of
            writing such as professional, technical documentation, scientific writing, and creative writing.
          <h2>A little <em>more</em> about me...</h2>
          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy writing Fantasy and Horror stories. Growing up, I kept journals when on vacation
            and during signifigant events in my life.
            These are often a source of my writing pool and I review them periodically to pad my fiction with realistic
            scenarios.
            I enjoy travelling, on a plane, in a car or on a train.
          </p>
          <p>
            My Biology minor stems from an avid fascination for animal care. I've kept a menagerie of house pets that
            include several uncommon species. Some of my favorite pet projects have included
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Chameleons (veiled, panther)</li>
            <li>African Pygmy Hedgehog</li>
            <li>Hairless guinea pigs</li>
            <li>Madagascar Hissing Cockroach</li>
            <li>Axolotls</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a compromise for my "hobby" of raising so many animals, each one required a short research paper before
            taking on the responsibility of bringing them into our home. This directly led me toward my chosen fields of
            study, as writing and animal care were always something closely entwined.
          </p>
          <p>
            My most interesting animal experiment included breeding the Axolotls. While I anticipated a yield of a dozen
            or so, the final (shocking) product was over 200 healthy younglings!
