           The goal of my portfolio is to showacse my writing skills: Professional, technical, and creative writing skills. My skills include:
           <ul>
            <li>Professional Writing: I can write clear, concise, and accurate written documents. I also can adapt my style and tone to suit the audience and purpose, and adhere to professional standards in grammar, punctuation, and structure.</li>
            <li>Technical writing: I can translate complex information clearly and concisely to suit it to specific audiences and formats, while also ensuring accuracy and accessibility.</li>
            <li>Creative Writing: I love making engaging and imaginative narratives, poems, or other forms of creative expression. I tend to focus more on short stories and novel length writings. I can be flexible.</li>
            <li>Scientific Writing: I can generate writing that communicates scientific information to other scientists in a document and/or presentation in written form. It requires a lot of research and exact wording such as grant requests, peer reviews and summarized findings. I am very good at researching materials needed for scientific writings.</li> 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am pursuing a career in Professional Writing, Technical Documentation, and my studies have been focussed
            in those areas.
