            Welcome! My name is Olivia Yahner. I am an aspiring writer with an interest in different types of
            professional writing such as technical documentation, scientific writing, and creative writing. I am from
            Norwell Massachusetts, having graduated from Norwell High school in 2021. I attended my first year of
            college at the University of Maine at Orono deciding to transfer to the University of Massachusetts Amherst
            for my second year. I graduated college in May of 2025 and am now excited to start my career.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy writing Fantasy and Horror stories. Growing up, I always kept journals during
            holiday travels and other signifigant events in my life. These are often a source for my writing pool and I review them
            periodically to pad my fiction with realistic scenarios. I enjoy travelling, the journeys just as much as the destinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My Biology minor stems from an avid fascination for animal care. I've kept a menagerie of pets that
            include several uncommon species. Some of my favorite pet projects have included
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Chameleons (veiled, panther)</li>
            <li>African Pygmy Hedgehog</li>
            <li>Hairless guinea pigs</li>
            <li>Madagascar Hissing Cockroach</li>
            <li>Axolotls</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a compromise for my "hobby" of raising so many animals, my parents requested a short research proposal. They would 
            evaluate and inevitably approve the request as a commitment of responsibility for bringing them into our home. This directly 
            led me toward my chosen fields of study, as writing and animal care were always something closely entwined for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            My most interesting animal experiment in high school included breeding the Axolotls. While I anticipated a yield of a dozen
            or so, the final (shocking) product was over 200 healthy younglings! We re-homed them to local pet stores.
