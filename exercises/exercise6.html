    <h1>About me - Olivia Yahner</h1>
    <img src="../images/headshot-600px.png" alt="Olivia Yahner Portrait" width="300">
    <p>
      I am a Senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am finishing my English major with a minor in
      Biology. My studies include a concentration in Creative Writing as well as Professional Writing and
      Technical Communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am pursuing a career in Professional Writing, Technical Documentation, and my studies have been focussed
      in those areas.

    <h2>A little <em>more</em> about me...</h2>
    <p>
      In my spare time I enjoy writing Fantasy and Horror stories. Growing up, I kept journals when on vacation
      and during significant events in my life.
      These are often a source of my writing pool and I review them periodically to pad my fiction with realistic
      scenarios.
      I enjoy travelling, on a plane, in a car or on a train.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Biology minor stems from an avid fascination for animal care. I've kept a menagerie of house pets that
      include several uncommon species. Some of my favorite pet projects have included
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chameleons (veiled, panther)</li>
      <li>African Pygmy Hedgehog</li>
      <li>Hairless guinea pigs</li>
      <li>Madagascar Hissing Cockroach</li>
      <li>Axolotls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a compromise for my "hobby" of raising so many animals, each one required a short research paper before
      taking on the responsibility of bringing them into our home. This directly led me toward my chosen fields of
      study, as writing and animal care were always something closely entwined.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most interesting animal experiment included breeding the Axolotls. While I anticipated a yield of a dozen
      or so, the final (shocking) product was over 200 healthy younglings!
