          <h2>Feasibility Memo</h2>
          <p>This memo is a proposal of my feasibility study to my instructor David Toomey who asked us to write a
            feasibility study on a topic of our choice that would act as a start up towards our Grant Proposal.

          <h2>Feasibility Study</h2>
          <p>My refined feasibility study on developing a therapy program for immigrants in the east coast is based on
            the feedback I received from my instructor Professor David Toomey. It is the starting point and foundation
            towards my final project: The Grant Proposal.
