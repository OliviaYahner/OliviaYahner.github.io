        <h2>My Pets</h2>
        <p>
          The pets are exotic animals and are not as common as owning a cat, dog, or a parakeet. The facts below contain
          scientific information about each creature or simple fun facts.<br>
          For simplicity, I have limited my fact list to the following types, ordered by my favorites:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hairless Guinea Pigs</li>
          <li>Chameleons</li>
          <li>Axolotls</li>

          <li>Hairless guinea pigs were discovered in the 1970's as a result of genetic mutation due to research
            experiments
            in dermatology.</li>
          <li>Also called skinny pigs, they are used in studies of skin reactions and pigmintation because their
            skin
            works very similar to human skin.</li>
          <li>Their unique look made them become a popular pets, they aren't completely hairless and have hair on their
            legs
            and noses.</li>

          <li>There are more than 200 species of chameleons, as well as 23 subspecies.</li>
          <li>Chameleons don't change color to camoflage. That is a common misconception. Most chameleons are already
            colors of leaves, bark, branches and sand. They change colors due to stress or other strong emotions.</li>
          <li>Chameleon's have panoramic vision, they can rotate each eye separately to focus on two different things at
            once. </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Axolotls can lay up to 1,000 eggs at a time, two weeks later the eggs hatch and the babies are left to
            defend
            for themselves as soon as they are born.</li>
          <li>Axolotls have a massive DNA genome, 10 times larger than humans and over 32 billion individual DNA
            strands.
          </li>
          <li>They are critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, polution, and invasive species. Wild
            axolotls
            can only be found in Lake Xochimilco</li>
