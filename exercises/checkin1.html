          <li>Hairless guinea pigs were discovered in the 1970s as a result of genetic mutation due to research
            experiments
            in dermatology.</li>
          <li>Also called skinny pigs, they are used in studies of skin reactions and pigmentation because their
            skin
            works very similarly to human skin.</li>
          <li>Their unique look made them popular pets. They aren't completely hairless and have hair on their
            legs
            and noses.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>There are more than 200 species of chameleons, as well as 23 subspecies.</li>
          <li>Chameleons don't change color to camouflage. That is a common misconception. Most chameleons are already
            colors of leaves, bark, branches, and sand. They change colors due to stress or other strong emotions.</li>
          <li>Chameleons have panoramic vision; they can rotate each eye separately to focus on two different things at
            once. </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Axolotls can lay up to 1,000 eggs at a time. Two weeks later, the eggs hatch, and the babies are left to
            fend
            for themselves as soon as they are born.</li>
          <li>Axolotls have a massive DNA genome, 10 times larger than humans and over 32 billion individual DNA
            strands.</li>
          <li>They are critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, pollution, and invasive species. Wild
            axolotls
            can only be found in Lake Xochimilco.</li>
